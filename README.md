## Technologies

I used `html`, `css`,`React.Js`,`ChakraUI`,`Framer Motion`,`React-Router-Dom`, `React-Icons`, `RxJs` ...

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- Install dependencies `yarn install`
- Run aplication `yarn run dev`
- Build aplication `yarn build`
- Build Preview aplication `yarn preview`

## Approach

I used the react js framework to create each of the functional components for the app, the styling was applied using the ChakraUi style library, I used both react context Api and rxjs to control the data and interactions of the functionalities.
Since chakra has a deficit with the elements that use clipPath use a .css stylesheet to make up for that deficit and get to the proposed design.

## Status

[YoMeAnimoAPP] is still in progress. `Version 3.0.2` will be out soon.
